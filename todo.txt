####Build login and logout flow with refresh token 

# Login Flow
1. User provides their credentials (username and password).
2. Server verifies the credentials.
3. If the credentials are valid, generate a refresh token and an access token.
4. Store the refresh token securely on the server.
5. Send the access token back to the client.
6. Client stores the access token securely (e.g., in a cookie or local storage).

# Send and Resend OTP
1. User requests to send OTP.
2. Server generates a new OTP and associates it with the user's account.
3. Server sends the OTP to the user's registered email or phone number.
4. Client displays a message to the user indicating that the OTP has been sent.

# Resend OTP
1. User requests to resend OTP.
2. Server generates a new OTP and updates it for the user's account.
3. Server sends the new OTP to the user's registered email or phone number.
4. Client displays a message to the user indicating that the new OTP has been sent.


# Token Exchange with refresh token
1. User sends a request to the server to exchange the refresh token for a new access token.
2. Server verifies the refresh token.
3. If the refresh token is valid, generate a new access token.
4. Send the new access token back to the client.
5. Client stores the new access token securely (e.g., in a cookie or local storage).


# Logout Flow
1. User initiates the logout process (e.g., by clicking on a "Logout" button).
2. Client sends a request to the server to invalidate the refresh token.
3. Server deletes the refresh token from the storage.
4. Server may also invalidate the access token (optional).
5. Client clears the stored access token (e.g., by removing the cookie or clearing local storage).
6. User is logged out and redirected to the login page (optional).
